## 📚 Library App

**Library** is a simple, responsive, and interactive web application that allows users to manage a personal library of books. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, it lets users add, track, and delete books from their reading list—all with a clean UI and optional dark mode.

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced

This project was built as a learning exercise and helped reinforce the following JavaScript and web development concepts:

* **DOM Manipulation** – Selecting, creating, updating, and deleting DOM elements dynamically.
* **Object-Oriented Programming** – Using a `Book` class with a constructor to encapsulate book-related data and behavior.
* **Class Constructors** – Creating reusable book objects using `class Book { constructor(...) { ... } }`.
* **Factory Functions** *(optional direction for extension)* – Can be used as an alternative to constructors for object creation.
* **Event Handling** – Handling user interactions such as clicks and form submissions.
* **State Management** – Managing the library of books through an array and updating the UI accordingly.
* **Form Validation** – Ensuring all inputs are filled before a book is added.
* **CSS Grid and Variables** – Building a responsive layout and maintaining design consistency via `:root` variables.
* **Dark Mode Toggle** – Implementing a light/dark theme using `data-theme` attributes and smooth transitions.
